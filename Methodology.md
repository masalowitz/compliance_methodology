# Compliance Methodology

## General Principles

A well-implemented enterprise compliance policy begins with determining the baseline standard which most closely aligns with the secruity requirements of your ogranization, whether it be a US DOD STIG, a US Civilian NIST control set, other Non-US standards, or even commercial guidance available from various published sources. In addition to the generally published policies, your organization may have additional rules or more restrictive rules than the published document. A healthy enterprise compliance policy is the sum of the constituent parts created by comparing and contrasting all available sources of policy, then [usually] selecting the most restrictive of conflicting controls.
